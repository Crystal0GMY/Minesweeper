# Writeups
## Bonus Point: 
I have done the Flag Bomb Function. 
## What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
State Management: Keeping track of game state (board, mines, revealed cells, flags, etc.) was one of the key challenges. Ensuring that the game logic correctly updates when a user clicks on a cell, marks a flag, or reveals a cell requires careful handling of state transitions.

## Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
Timer and Scoreboard: Adding a timer that tracks how long it takes to complete the game would enhance the gameplay experience. A scoreboard showing the best times for different difficulty levels could also add replayability.
Hints or Undo Button: Implementing a hint system that helps the player by revealing a safe cell or providing an "undo" button would improve the accessibility and fun factor.

## What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
User Understanding of Minesweeper: I assumed the user had a basic understanding of how Minesweeper works (i.e., flagging bombs and revealing cells), so the game did not include a tutorial.

## How long did this assignment take to complete?
The project took approximately 10â€“12 hours to complete, including designing the game logic, building the React components, implementing CSS for layout, and debugging the functionality.
